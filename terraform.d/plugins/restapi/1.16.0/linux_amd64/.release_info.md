## New
- Exposed a property always available inside `api_object` to the datasource. You can now set `search_path` to search in one location, but pull object information from another location!
- Added a new `test_path` attribute to the provider which will make a no-op call to the API after setting up the provider. Thanks, @yi2020 for the idea in #118!
- Allow passing oauth endpoint params to the client library - thanks @larryboymi for the idea in @136

## Fixed
- A large amount of refactoring was done by @sirlatrom to make `go vet` and `golint` happier in #112 - awesome!
- Permit attempting to obtain an Oauth2 token without scopes set since it is not required. Thanks, @Thorln for reporting the issue!
- Improved test cases for the datasource performing searches. Thanks, @BigJerBD for the nudge in #119!
- Add .exe to the end of Windows release files. Thanks, @dmachard for the report in #130!
- In cases where invalid JSON was pushed to the .tf file, Terraform writes it to state - work around this. Thanks, @m-v-k for the report in #117!

## Misc
- Taught fakeserver a new trick - the `/api/object_list` endpoint will now dump all of the objects as if responding to search
- Added an example for those that would like to set a custom Authorization header coming from outside of the terraform config
- Added an example for performing regular PUT updates to a resource as a "fancy curl" - thanks @vmarlier!
- This is the first release that should be compliant with the terraform registry expectations - big thanks to @blz-ea
- Added a validation at terraform's input level to ensure that the `data` attribute is valid JSON before attempting any work
